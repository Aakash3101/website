One of the fundamental scales of measurement in ecology  is the
individual, because individual organisms are a  core biological
unit that respond directly to  environmental conditions and
biotic interactions. Ideal data for large-scale ecology would
provide information on  every individual over large geographic
extents, but  individual-level data is difficult and expensive
to  collect. We are working to bridge this gap by combining
newly available remote sensing and field data with innovative
machine learning approaches to generate estimates of
individual-level data on the location, size, traits, and species
identity of individual trees at scales of 10,000+ ha using data
from the [National Ecological Observatory
Network](http://www.neonscience.org/) (NEON).
