> Macroecology is way of studying relationships between organisms and their environment that involves characterizing and explaining statistical patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity. - Jim Brown

Macroecology involves the study of both large scale ecological patterns and use of data-intensive approaches to yield insights into the processes governing the behavior of ecological systems. We use macroecological approaches to study a numerous aspects of ecology including biodiversity, body size, and community dynamics.
