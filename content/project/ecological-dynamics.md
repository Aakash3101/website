Studying how ecological systems change through time is central to
understanding the processes driving the system and is crucial for predicting
how natural systems will change in the future. We have a number of projects
focused on understanding and predicting dynamics including:

* Studying changes in our Portal Project research site over the past 40 years
* Analyses of large numbers of time-series datasets to look for general patterns
* Forecasting the future state of natural systems
* Developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how ecosystems change
