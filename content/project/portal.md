Portal is our long-term field site in southern Arizona. For over 40 years, ecologists have studied the dynamics of rodents, plants, and ants on this patch of desert. We are the current custodians of the project and it plays an active role in our research. We use the Portal Project as a sandbox for our ideas about species interactions, community dynamics, and modern data management.

Current Projects Using Portal Data:

* Quantifying community dynamics
* Forecasting the future state of the system
* Abiotic and biotic drivers of diet overlap

All of the data from the Portal Project is publicly available in near real time and we develop an R package to make working with the Portal data easier and more efficient:

* [Data](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData)
* [portalr R package](https://github.com/weecology/portalr)
