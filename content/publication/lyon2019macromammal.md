abstract = "The field of macroecology has made many contributions to our understanding of mammalian ecology and evolution through its use of big data and the examination of statistical patterns that emerge. Here, we review the advances in three areas of mammalian macroecology: 1) spatial and temporal patterns of assemblage structure and space use, 2) the processes and constraints underlying the evolution of body size and life history, and 3) advances in understanding and predicting loss of biodiversity. We highlight the important role that studies of mammals have played in the advancement of macroecological theories and patterns, and note that both mammalogy and macroecology are richer because of this linkage."
