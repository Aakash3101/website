# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Ecology operates on many scales of space and time, from processes acting extremely locally or rapidly to those acting across large expanses, or over millennia. To understand all these scales of ecology, and how they interact, we need data that capture the full range of underlying processes. Writing in Nature Ecology & Evolution, Estes and colleagues1 examine contemporary literature and past meta-analyses, and find that ecological data have been collected on only a narrow range of space and time, but that new technologies may be helping to change this."
