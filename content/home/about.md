Weecology is an interdisciplinary ecology research group at the University of Florida. It is composed of Morgan Ernest's lab, which studies how ecological systems change through time and has a strong field work component, and Ethan White's lab which uses computational and statistical methods to understand ecological systems using large ecological and environmental datasets. We do cutting edge research, collect and publish large open datasets, develop open source software, build websites, train scientists in computational tools, and generally try to make science a better, more efficient, more diverse and inclusive place.
