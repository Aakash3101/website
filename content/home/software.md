We build tools to make doing science easier and more efficient by automating the
early phases of the data analysis pipeline.

- [Data Retriever](https://www.data-retriever.org/): A package manager for
  data. It downloads, cleans, and stores publicly available data, so analysts
  spend less time managing data, and more time analyzing it. Available
  for
  [Python](https://github.com/weecology/retriever),
  [R](https://github.com/ropensci/rdataretriever),
  [Julia](https://github.com/weecology/Retriever.jl), and
  the [command line](https://github.com/weecology/retriever).
- [portalr](https://github.com/weecology/portalr): Quickly download, clean, and
  work with data from the Portal Project.
